These are files I have worked on over the years most are batch files and a few python scripts decrypt and encrypt.py only work on linux and other debian based systems since they use their console commands,
batch files work on windows the projects here should be ready to execute,
python files need an interpreter to run.

know.bat are just somne notes while piece.bat was a piece to a bigger project.

## test.bat will crash a windows computer and delete a lot of files & directories whether you run it as admin or not you can reboot your system. Anything not backed up will be lost.
if you do run it on your computer by mistake turn your computer off immediately!! ##

The keylogger needs an auto run USB and an interpreter to run on the target machine ## However it doesn not track any special keys such as every key that is not alphanumeric will throw a 'CHAR ERROR' you would have to guess and infer by checking out the output in the file. The file can be found in the path of what the interpreter is in such as 'C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.11.exe' it could be anything like that.
